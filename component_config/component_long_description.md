The Dropbox Extractor allows you to easily integrate files stored in Dropbox into your Keboola workflows.

Provide one or more public Dropbox share links, and the component will automatically download each file and save it as a table in Keboola Storage. All downloads are converted into CSV format and come with automatically generated manifest files, ensuring seamless integration into your data pipelines.

You can optionally choose the target bucket where the tables will be stored, giving you flexibility in organizing your datasets. The extractor handles multiple files in one run and safely masks sensitive tokens in logs to protect your data.

This component is designed as a modern replacement for the older Node.js Dropbox Extractor. It preserves compatibility with existing configurations while improving performance, security, and maintainability.

Use the Dropbox Extractor to quickly bring external files from Dropbox into Keboola for further transformation, analysis, or export to downstream systems.
